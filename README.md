This a project that develops a portal for executing tapes and drivers using binary files and bash scripts.
The data in the company I am interning is stored in the form of cartridges instead of hard disks. A cardtrige
is a data storing device where data can be stored sequentially.The data is accessed through a pointer of a driver that traverses
the cartridge consisting of various tapes. User authentication has been implemented using LDAP.
